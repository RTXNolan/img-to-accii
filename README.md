The code starts by fetching an image from a specified URL using the requests library. After downloading the image, it resizes it to fit within a smaller area and converts it to grayscale, which simplifies the color information to shades of gray. Then, it maps the brightness levels of the grayscale pixels to ASCII characters, where darker pixels correspond to denser characters like '@' or '#' while lighter pixels are represented by characters like '.' or ' '. This process creates an ASCII art representation of the original image, displaying it on the console as a series of ASCII characters that collectively form the image.
